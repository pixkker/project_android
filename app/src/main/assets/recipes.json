      "description": "Hinata is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. He inherits the number 10 from his idol, the former Karasuno ace known as the Tiny Giant. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and though he wishes to become the team's ace, he grows to learn the importance of the decoy role and embraces it. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular. He is able to play exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter.",

While prodigiously talented, Kageyama's arrogant demeanor and inability to cooperate with teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match, which deeply affected him and earned his nickname. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball. Kageyama is regarded by many to be a genius, with exceptional accuracy and instincts, and is one of the team's pillars.",
